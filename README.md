# Flappybird for MATLAB

As one of the most popular games on app stores before being taken down, Flappy Bird does not need any further introduction. Now, it has come back alive, on MATLAB.

This implementation is intentionally made to replicate the user experience of the original game, with all physical dimensions of objects being identical. The gravity and 'jumping pulse' are also carefully adjusted so that they match the original settings as closely as possible.

*MATLAB R2016a or higher* is recommended for the best graphical performance

## Usage:
Run *flappybird.m*

## Control:
Spacebar/Return/Uparrow/W/ -> Jump/Start game/Restart game;
ESC -> Quit game.

** If you encounter any problem, or have any suggestions / feedbacks, please leave a comment. **

Enjoy endless flapping!
